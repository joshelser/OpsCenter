# OpsCenter for Snowflake Licensing FAQ

## What is BSL and an additional use grant?

BSL is a license that gives you access to source code, and gives you the right to make non-production use of software. Our BSL has an additional use grant, which allows you to make production use for internal business purposes, but not to distribute the software or offer it as a service.

## What does the additional use grant allow?

* You can use this application within your organization as much as you’d like.
* You can can modify the application for your own use.
* If a customer engages you to customize the application, you can customize it for that specific customer to use within their organization.

## What does this license prohibit?
You may not sell this application or a modification of this application that you made. Selling includes both softwareon-premises distribution and offering the software as a service. A few examples:
* You may not fork the repo, introduce additional reports / analytics and then sell access to the resultant application.
* You may not change the user interface (UI) and then sell the resultant application.
* You may not alter the analytics to focus for a specific industry, such as manufacturing, and then sell the resultant application.

## Can I contribute to the app?
YES! This is a community-driven project. If accepted, your contributions will be made available via our free-to-use Snowflake Native App. Because of this, you'll need to sign our CLA so that we can include your changes in that listing.

## Can I fork the application and make my own?
Yes, as long as you don’t sell it or distribute it to others.

## My customer wants me to customize this application for them and they’re paying me / my company for this work. Does that count as re-selling or distribution?
This is fine as long as you're doing customizations specifically for your client. If you want to distribute the same customizations to multiple organizations, they'll need to be incorporated into the sundeck-io/opscenter repository in order to be distributed. Contractors or consultants who wish to use the application to easily deliver on their professional services engagements are encouraged to leverage our application. We’d love your feedback.

## I’m not sure whether my specific scenario is covered by this FAQ. What do I do?
Contact support@sundeck.io and we’ll gladly discuss your scenario with you.

## I’d like to modify this application and sell it. The modifications will make it substantially different from what you’ve created. What could be done?
Contact support@sundeck.io and we can work together to find a path forward.
